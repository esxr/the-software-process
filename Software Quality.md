### QnA
**Why does software quality management focus on the development process and not on the software product?**

The quality of the software product is hard to determine early in the project. By focussing on the development process, we can ensure that quality is met throughout the project instead of at the end of the development cycle. Corrections as a result of bad quality are more easily made during the development of the product, as oppose to only at the end. Also by ensuring that the development process is in line with quality guidelines, this prevents quality issues that could have been present in the final product (better to prevent that to cure).
