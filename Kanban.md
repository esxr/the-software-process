### Disadvantages

1.  One disadvantage of Kanban is that it is **not used as an independent process**, and is a methodology that **canâ€™t be applied without** it being merged with **another** software process such as **scrum**.
    
2.  Another disadvantage of Kanban is that the **boards can become too complex** if there are too many interconnected activities or tasks needed to be carried out. The over-complexity can mitigate its effectiveness, especially if tasks pile up and are left uncompleted.
