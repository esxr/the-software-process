### Unified vs OPEN

___
Incremental models explicitly encourage a multi-staged release of a product and tend to be more recent than the structured models.

- System is built in a series of stages from a minimally functional shell, or partial system, to a fully integrated system. 
- Intention is to reduce risk in the development process. 
- Risky and unknown aspects of the development can be tried first 
	- find if the risk is acceptable and if not the project can be cancelled early.
- Incremental approach also means that part of a system is delivered to the client early in the development process so that they can judge if it meets their needs and provide feedback to the developers.
