# Estimation
Estimates are based on incomplete information. Accuracy should increase when the project proceeds
___
### Quick Overview

___
### Overview
- Get initial feel for the project cost
	- Should be a range rather than a single value
	- Based on real data
- Determine if the project is still feasible

___
### Guidelines
- Use a structured and defined process
	- Apply throughout the project
- Collect and use **historical data**
- Apply multiple techniques and compare results
	- Apply statistical analysis
- Look for automation options
- Adjust to suit new projects

___
### Problems
- Lack of historical data -> instinctive estimation
- Overly optimistic
- Depend on experience
- Unique aspects of projects

___
### QnA

**Explain how developer productivity affects software estimates. What can an organisation do to take into account developer productivity when estimating time to complete development work?**Â 

The developer's productivity affects the software estimates as this impacts how quickly they are able to complete a task. The organization can account for this by using the team's velocity instead of individual developers and also use past projects as a reference to determine the velocity of the team as well as the time needed for development.
