### Maturity Levels (CMMI)
**Capability Maturity Model Integration** is a process level improvement training and appraisal program. Administered by the CMMI Institute, a subsidiary of ISACA, it was developed at Carnegie Mellon University. 

<span style="background-color: #cfc ; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px; border: 1px solid green;">
It is required by many U.S. Government contracts 
</span> especially in software development.

___
### Overview
- **Starting**
	• Ad-hoc and occasionally chaotic
	• Few processes are defined and success depends on individual effort (rather than teamwork)
	• During crisis, projects typically abandon planned procedures and revert to coding and testing.

- **Repeatable**
	• Basic project management process (Track cost, schedule and functionality)
	• Process discipline is in place to repeat earlier success on similar projects
	• Project standards are defined (management ensures they are followed)
	• Commitments are understood and managed.

- **Defined**
	• Process for both management and engineering activities is documented and standardised
	• Projects tailor the standard process (develop their own process to account for unique characteristics
	of the project)
	• Organisational process improvement effort (Software engineering process group (SEPG)

- **Managed**
	• Relationships between cost, schedule and quality are understood in numerical terms
	• Performance is predictable
	• Quantitative product quality and process productivity goals are set for each project.
	• Product quality and process productivity are continuously measured and corrective action taken
	when required
	• Organisation-wide software process database is used to collect and analyse data about software
	processes.

- **Optimising**
	• Continuous process improvement
		- Quantitative feedback from process
		- Piloting innovative ideas and technologies
	• Software teams analyse defects to determine their causes
		- Evaluate software processes to prevent known types of defects from recurring
		- Disseminate lessons throughout organisation.

### Detail
![[Pasted image 20220610042411.png]]

### Initial
At maturity level 1, processes are usually ad hoc and chaotic. The organization usually does **not provide a stable environment**. Success in these organizations **depends on the competence and heroics** of the people in the organization and not on the use of proven processes.

Maturity level 1 organizations often produce products and services that work; however, they **frequently exceed the budget and schedule** of their projects.

Maturity level 1 organizations are characterized by a **tendency to over commit, abandon processes in the time of crisis, and not be able to repeat their past successes**.

### Managed
At maturity level 2, an organization has achieved all the **specific** and **generic goals** of the maturity level 2 process areas. In other words, the projects of the organization have ensured that **requirements are managed and that processes are planned, performed, measured, and controlled**.

The process discipline reflected by maturity level 2 helps to ensure that **existing practices are retained during times of stress**. When these practices are in place, projects are performed and managed according to their documented plans.

At maturity level 2, **requirements, processes, work products, and services are managed**. The status of the work products and the delivery of services are visible to management at defined points.

Commitments are established among relevant stakeholders and are revised as needed. Work products are reviewed with stakeholders and are controlled.

The work products and services satisfy their specified requirements, standards, and objectives.

### Defined
At maturity level 3, an organization has achieved all the **specific** and **generic goals** of the process areas assigned to maturity levels 2 and 3.

At maturity level 3, processes are well characterized and understood, and are described in standards, procedures, tools, and methods.

A critical distinction between maturity level 2 and maturity level 3 is the scope of standards, process descriptions, and procedures. 
- At maturity level 2, the standards, process descriptions, and procedures may be quite different in each specific instance of the process (for example, on a particular project). 
- At maturity level 3, the standards, process descriptions, and procedures for a project are tailored from the organization's set of standard processes to suit a particular project or organizational unit. 

The organization's set of standard processes includes the processes addressed at maturity level 2 and maturity level 3. As a result, the processes that are performed across the organization are consistent except for the differences allowed by the tailoring guidelines.

Another critical distinction is that at maturity level 3, processes are typically described in more detail and more rigorously than at maturity level 2. At maturity level 3, processes are managed more proactively using an understanding of the interrelationships of the process activities and detailed measures of the process, its work products, and its services.

### Quantitatively Managed
At maturity level 4, an organization has achieved all the **specific goals** of the process areas assigned to maturity levels 2, 3, and 4 and the **generic goals** assigned to maturity levels 2 and 3.

At maturity level 4 Subprocesses are selected that significantly contribute to overall process performance. These selected subprocesses are controlled using statistical and other quantitative techniques.

Quantitative objectives for quality and process performance are established and used as criteria in managing processes. Quantitative objectives are based on the needs of the customer, end users, organization, and process implementers. Quality and process performance are understood in statistical terms and are managed throughout the life of the processes.

For these processes, detailed measures of process performance are collected and statistically analyzed. Special causes of process variation are identified and, where appropriate, the sources of special causes are corrected to prevent future occurrences.

Quality and process performance measures are incorporated into the organization.s measurement repository to support fact-based decision making in the future.

A critical distinction between maturity level 3 and maturity level 4 is the predictability of process performance. At maturity level 4, the performance of processes is controlled using statistical and other quantitative techniques, and is quantitatively predictable. At maturity level 3, processes are only qualitatively predictable.

### Optimizing
At maturity level 5, an organization has achieved all the **specific goals** of the process areas assigned to maturity levels 2, 3, 4, and 5 and the **generic goals** assigned to maturity levels 2 and 3.

Processes are continually improved based on a quantitative understanding of the common causes of variation inherent in processes.

Maturity level 5 focuses on continually improving process performance through both incremental and innovative technological improvements.

Quantitative process-improvement objectives for the organization are established, continually revised to reflect changing business objectives, and used as criteria in managing process improvement.

The effects of deployed process improvements are measured and evaluated against the quantitative process-improvement objectives. Both the defined processes and the organization's set of standard processes are targets of measurable improvement activities.

Optimizing processes that are agile and innovative depends on the participation of an empowered workforce aligned with the business values and objectives of the organization. The organization's ability to rapidly respond to changes and opportunities is enhanced by finding ways to accelerate and share learning. Improvement of the processes is inherently part of everybody's role, resulting in a cycle of continual improvement.

A critical distinction between maturity level 4 and maturity level 5 is the type of process variation addressed. At maturity level 4, processes are concerned with addressing special causes of process variation and providing statistical predictability of the results. Though processes may produce predictable results, the results may be insufficient to achieve the established objectives. At maturity level 5, processes are concerned with addressing common causes of process variation and changing the process (that is, shifting the mean of the process performance) to improve process performance (while maintaining statistical predictability) to achieve the established quantitative process-improvement objectives.

### QnA

**Consider an organisation that is following all aspects of the Spiral process for software projects in a disciplined manner. What do you believe would be the highest CMMI level at which this organisation could be rated? Justify your answer. Explain which aspects of the Spiral process contribute to your rating.**

Level 2, the spiral process doesn't focus much on improvement for its process. However it does have the basic project management and a repeatable process needed for level 2.
