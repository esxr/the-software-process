___
### Quick Overview
[[Use Case Modelling Examples|examples]]
- [product vs user centric](https://www.packagingdevelopments.com/blog/user-centred-design-vs-product-centred-design/)
	- user centric modeling is preferred
- basis for acceptance testing

___
### Process
- Identify actors
	- e.g. Borrower - primary, Librarian - secondary 
- Identify initial use cases -> [[Requirements Engineering]]
	- source of usecases: <span style="background-color: #cfc ; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px; border: 1px solid green;">
Requirements Engineering 
</span>
	- e.g. Borrow Book, Return Book, Lost Book
- Produce use case diagram
	- Identify packages
	- ![[Pasted image 20220610022608.png|300]]
- Develop initial use cases
- Refine use cases
	- UI/UX prototyping
	- Restructure use cases

___
### Basic Rules
System doesn't use itself

Actors are external to the system, not within

Actors are not technical choices

- Primary actor - **Bank customer** - actor that the system is designed to serve
- Secondary actor - **Bank** - actor that helps in serving the system
