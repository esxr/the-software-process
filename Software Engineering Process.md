- A **process** - *entire set of procedures and techniques*
	- a **methodology** - part of a process that describes 
		- how to order tasks
		- determine which techniques are applicable for different tasks

class 
</span> means an abstract description of a generalized approach (or model) of developing software.
	- **process** <span style="background-color: yellow; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px; border: 1px solid black;">
object 
</span> then is a concrete implementation of a model that provides strong guidelines of how the process is meant to be followed
