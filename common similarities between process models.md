### Incremental (or iterative) and Agile
- Both software processes aim to release early and often. This to break down large projects into smaller subsections to reduce time wasted on making decisions that will be changed later, catch errors before they are too large and provide value early.
- Both software processes are better suited for smaller projects. Majority of agile and lean projects are ideal for smaller teams (e.g. agile < 12 developers) due to the processes involved. This is in contrast with the waterfall. 
- Both software processes aim to be open to change.
