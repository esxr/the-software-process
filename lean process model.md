‘Developer chooses from many tasks in backlog and works on those that are most needed’, the priority of these may change and is similar to Agile in this way (accepting change) 

**More a philosophy than a process**

### Lean Disadvantages

-   Lack of time – needs time and planning upfront
    
-   A lack of strategy – losing sight of the bigger picture while trying to focus on Lean tactics
    
-   Cutting things too fine – only the highest priority work is delivered so if there is a bottleneck on resources then delays can start occurring.
    
-   Not enough buy-in – teams need to work independently without too much direction
