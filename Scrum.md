### Disadvantages

1.  One disadvantage of Scrum is that it **requires experienced team members** to carry out. The constant feedback that team members (or scrum masters) give must be done by experienced team members, **lack of knowledge** or expertise **can break down** the project.
    
2.  Another issue with scrum is that it can be **hard to scale up to large projects**. As each team is quite small, executing it on a **large scale requires precise coordination**, which is often complex and hard to understand.

## Large-Scale Scrum

#### Sprint — start and end at the same time and have same length
In LeSS all the Scrum Teams working on the Product Backlog work within the same Sprint. All teams start and end the Sprint at the same time. In Scrum it is -intentionally- not described how the Sprint length is to be aligned.

#### Sprint Planning — Split in two parts to align
Just like Scrum the Sprint Planning consists of two parts. The first part of the Sprint planning is usually not conducted with all people from all the Scrum Teams, unlike standard Scrum. Instead every team has one or more representatives in order to limit the number of attendants.

The first part of the planning is about setting the Sprint Goal and selecting the Product Backlog Items that help to meet this goal. Just like in standard Scrum. The Scrum Teams divide the number of items between themselves.

The second part of the planning is for the individual Development Teams to create their plan to finish the items and meeting the Sprint Goal, as it is in standard Scrum. LeSS advises to do the planning sessions in the same physical room to allow alignment between teams.

### QnA

**Would formal Fagan inspections be an appropriate verification technique to use in a team following Large Scale Scrum? Justify your answer. Identify two characteristics of Fagan inspections and explain why these make it suitable (or unsuitable) to apply in Large Scale Scrum? (Your answer to this last part of the question will depend on your answer to the first part of the question.)**

Fagan inspections are very time consuming, and if performed in a large-scale project can restrict the speed of development. The meetings meticulously examine code, and if the project is large-scale, a lot of code needs to be reviewed which can be infeasible in a large-scale environment.
