- **Release** planning focuses on deliverable features: the smallest set of stories/cases that deliver immediate business value. 
	- **Sprint** planning focuses on a subsection of the release plan which can be completed in an iteration. Each sprint will contribute to part of a release. 

___
**A sprint is a potential release, but most sprints are not releases** 

Sprints and Releases complement each other well. 
- **Sprints** are essentially a time frame to achieve team goals, 
	- whereas **Releases** are usually deliverables (the product itself or part of the product). 

**Difference of scale**
- **Sprint planning** is usually on a smaller scale because features from a release plan are chosen, which can be completed within a single iterative cycle. 
	- **Release planning** is on a larger scale because it can cover deliverables across multiple sprints.
